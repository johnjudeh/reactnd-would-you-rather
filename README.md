# Would You Rather...

## Description

Would You Rather is a platform where users can create and answer polls on life's great
questions. These polls are simple; they each contain two choices and you can't see what
other users answered until you submit your own answer. Try it out!


## The Task

The project was built as part of
[Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)
The goal of the project was to build the app from scratch using best practices in React
for the UI and Redux to manage its state.


## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), making it
very easy to set up and run locally. You simply need to clone the project and run two
commands. Let React do the rest.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```


## The Backend

The backend is being mocked by [_DATA.js](src/utils/_DATA.js) which was copied from the
[Starter Repo](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter) for
this project. A simple client was built around it [api.js](src/utils/api.js), to
simulate how it would be set it up if it was a real server this app was communicating
with.
